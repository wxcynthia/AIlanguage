## Abstract
Recent advancements in large language models have demonstrated that extended inference through techniques can markedly improve performance, yet these gains come with increased computational costs and the propagation of inherent biases found in natural languages. This paper explores the design of a unified AI-centric language system that addresses these challenges by offering a more concise, unambiguous, and computationally efficient alternative to traditional human languages.

## Project Overview
Our research proposes a framework that translates diverse natural language inputs into a streamlined AI-friendly language, enabling more efficient model training and inference while reducing memory footprints. The project analyzes limitations of natural language and examines how these issues affect current Transformer architectures.
